# Raycasting in TypeScript

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

My take on Raycasting inspired by Lode's Computer Graphics Tutorial: <https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html>

**We are intentinally rendering on HTML 2D Canvas without employing
any hardware acceleration to see how much we can push the boundaries
of the software rendering implemented in JavaScript running in
Browser. So the renderer may run unexpectedly slow on some machines
and browsers, but we are working it.**

## Quick Start

```console
npm run dev
<browser> https://localhost:6969/
```
